# Chatbot Application with RAG and PandasAI Integration

This project implements a chatbot application using Flask, integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and PandasAI to provide context-aware responses and data analysis capabilities. The chatbot is designed to assist users by generating natural language responses and creating visual data outputs based on user queries. The chatbot is specifically tailored to provide information about Akbank, a Turkish bank.


## Features


**Flask Web Framework:** Provides the web interface for interacting with the chatbot.

**RAG Model Integration:** Generates contextually relevant responses by retrieving documents from a ChromaDB collection.

**PandasAI Integration:** Processes and visualizes CSV data, responding to queries related to data analysis.

**File Upload and Deletion:** Users can upload CSV files for data analysis or delete them as needed.


## Response Types


**Textual Responses:** Generated using the RAG model for non-data-related queries.

**Visual Responses:** Generated by PandasAI for data-related queries, visualizing the results in charts.
